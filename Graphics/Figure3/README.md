## Figure 3
In order to rerun the experiments the same procedure as in the readme of the PyChest-Experiments folder has to be followed.  
The only difference is that the marked lines in prepare_tests.py need to be uncommented (and the unwanted experimented commented).

In order to create the left (Bernoulli) figure, one then has to run:
> `python prepare_tests.py 500 10000 500 20 1`

To create the right (Irration Rotation) figure, one then has to run:
> `python prepare_tests.py 5000 30000 5000 20 1`

The rest of the procedure is the same as in the readme of the PyChest-Experiments folder.
